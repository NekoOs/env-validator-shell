# Env Validator Shell <br><small>Validator for environment variables configuration file</small>

This is a script that allows you to validate the configuration of environment variables of a 
in deployment environments that do not allow the execution of project-specific languages,
if this is not your case, you can use libraries like: [Laravel Env Validator](https://github.com/mathiasgrimm/laravel-env-validator)
or [JS env-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-validator)

### Usage 

#### Validation from file

```

Available validation rules
--------------------------------

Below is a list of all available validation rules and their function:

- [Boolean](#boolean)  
- [Decimal](#decimal)
- [Integer](#integer)
- [Max](#maxvalue)
- [Min](#minvalue)
- [Numeric](#numeric)
- [Regular Expression](#regex)
- [Required](#required) 
- [Size](#sizevalue)  

#### [#](#boolean) boolean

The field under validation must be able to be cast as a boolean. Accepted input are `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, `"1"`, and `"0"`.

#### [#](#decimal) decimal

The field under validation must be a decimal point.

#### [#](#integer) integer

The field under validation must be an integer.

> **Note**
>
> This validation rule does not verify that the input is of the "integer" variable type, only that the input is a string or numeric value that contains an integer.

#### [#](#maxvalue) max:*value

The field under validation must be less than or equal to a maximum *value*. Strings, numerics, arrays, and files are evaluated in the same fashion as the [`size`](#sizevalue) rule.

#### [#](#minvalue) min:*value

The field under validation must have a minimum *value*. Strings, numerics, arrays, and files are evaluated in the same fashion as the [`size`](#sizevalue) rule.

#### [#](#numeric) numeric

The field under validation must be numeric.

#### [#](#regexpattern) regex:*pattern*

The field under validation must match the given regular expression.

#### [#](#required) required

The field under validation must be present in the input data and not empty. A field is considered "empty" if one of the following conditions are true:
- The value is 'null'.
- The value is an empty string.

#### [#](#sizevalue) size:*value

The field under validation must have a size matching the given value. For string data, value corresponds to the number of characters. For numeric data, value corresponds to a given integer value (the attribute must also have the numeric or integer rule).
